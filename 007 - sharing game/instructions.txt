1. zip all the fields (not the folder) of the project in a file and
give it the extension ".love". Ex: pong.love
2. create a separate folder in another directory and from the love installation
folder copy all the .dll plus the love.exe files and paste them in this new folder,
also add the .love file created in the last step.
3. within this new folder, create a new file with extension .bat (ex: build.bat)
and include the following code inside 
  copy /b love.exe+%1 "%~n1.exe"
save the file .bat file.
4. drag the .love file and drop it over the .bat file, this should create a
new .exe file
5. take all the .dll files plus the new .exe file and zip them in a single 
file, this file is what you need to share your game!.
